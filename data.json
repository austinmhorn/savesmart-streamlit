                "What is a budget? A budget is a plan for your spending. Tracking your purchases and living within a budget allows you to be confident that you’ve got the money to cover your essential living expenses. You’ll also be ready when unplanned expenses pop up, and even you’re able to pursue the things in life that are important to you.",

                "You can make a small and effective budget for yourself just by following these simple steps.

Then, make a list of fixed (rent, utilities) and variable (groceries, entertainment) monthly expenses. Include less frequent expenses by dividing annual or quarterly payments by 12.",
                "Once you have a breakdown or your spending, create and balance your budget by subtracting total expenses from total income for a surplus or deficit. Allocate surplus to savings or paying down debts, or adjust spending if there's a deficit. We tUse budgeting tools to track and adjust regularly."
